## Golang File Syncer

A tiny, hacky and not tested file syncer.
It is a real mass, do not use it until you know what you do!

** Don't expect any deaper documentation or something **

This is just a tiny small program for a small issue i need to solve on multiple platforms (windows & linux), so this is
a simple program.
You need something similar that copies files around? No problem, you can easily make the effort on your own.

# DO NOT USE!
